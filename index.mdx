## Getting started

LitmusCheck provides you human experts and an AI platform that can help you write test automation to improve the reliability of your product. You can get started either by:

- **Start onboarding**  
  If you want to work with us, schedule a call with one of our testing experts who will set things up for you.

- **Start a trial**  
  Create a trial account by going to [Sign up page](https://www.litmuscheck.com/sign-up) and following the onscreen instructions.

## Composing tests

### Compose View  
Create tests with your AI agent assisted by a live browser view.
![Compose](/images/compose.png)


### Live browser view  
The browser pane on the right shows your test in action.  
- Click **Start Run** to open the session.  
- Click **Stop** to end it.  
- Click **Rerun** to restart from the first step.
![Live view](/images/live-browser.png)


### Two ways to create tests

#### 1. Instructions  
![Instructions](/images/instructions.png)
Click **Add an instruction** and choose from:  
- **Click**: perform a mouse click  
- **Hover**: perform a mouse hover  
- **Select**: choose an option from a dropdown  
- **Input**: enter text into a field  
- **Go to URL**: navigate to a URL  
- **Go back**: go back in browser history  
- **New Tab**: open a URL in a new tab  
- **Run Script**: execute custom JavaScript (e.g., API calls or Playwright functions)  
- **Verify**: generate or write custom verification logic  
- **Reuse**: embed another test from the same suite  

> **Note:** You can edit/reorder/delete instructions when the live run is stopped. Once running, you can only append new steps.

#### 2. Goal agent  
![Goal Agent](/images/goal-agent.png)
Enter a natural-language goal in the bottom input and click **Go**. The autonomous agent will attempt all available actions to reach your goal. When complete (or if it gets stuck), it will show the sequence of steps it took. You can discard them or add them to your test.

> **Tip:** Keep goals simple for best results.

### Viewing script and selectors  
When an instruction runs, its generated script appears in the script box. Click the element description to toggle between available selectors.

### Saving and discarding  
- Click **Save** to persist your test (there is no autosave).  
- Click **Discard** to throw away unsaved changes.

---

## Running suites and tests

### Running once  
- **Suite**: navigate to the suite and click **Run**.  
- **Test**: navigate to the test and click **Run**.
![Run test](/images/test-actions.png)


### Scheduling suite runs  
![Scheduling runs](/images/schedule.png)
1. Open the suite and select the **Schedules** tab.  
2. Click **Add Schedule**.  
3. Choose hourly or daily recurrence.  
4. All schedules for that suite appear in this view.

> **Note:** Tests marked **Draft** will be skipped in automated runs but can be executed manually.

### External triggers  
Contact us to set up CI/CD or GitHub Actions triggers via our API.

1. Go to the suite.  
2. Click the **Logs** tab.  
3. Select a run to see a summary of its tests.

### Test run logs  
All test runs are logged, whether run individually or as part of a suite.  
1. Go to the test.  
2. Click the **Logs** tab for a run history.

### Debugging and run proofs  
![Test runs](/images/test-logs.png)
